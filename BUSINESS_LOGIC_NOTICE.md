- **Commercial Features** - Require commercial license
- **Performance Optimizations** - Enterprise-grade implementations

## How Protection Works

### File Protection
```bash
# Protected files are moved to .protected/ directory
.protected/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ algorithms/           # AI and ML algorithms
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ business-logic/       # Core business logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ai-models/           # Machine learning models
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ai-service-main.py.backup  # Original AI service
```

### Code Replacement
Protected functions are replaced with:
```typescript
export default function protectedFunction() {
    throw new Error('This functionality requires a commercial license. Contact contact@novumsolvo.com');
}
```

### AI Service Limitation
```python
@app.post("/analyze-logo")
async def analyze_logo(request: AnalyzeLogoRequest):
    raise HTTPException(
        status_code=501,
        detail="Advanced AI analysis requires commercial license. Contact contact@novumsolvo.com"
    )
```

## Development vs. Public Versions

### For Development (Internal Use)
```bash
# Restore protected files for development
./scripts/restore-business-logic.sh
```

### For Public Repository
```bash
# Protect business logic before pushing
./scripts/protect-business-logic.sh

# Verify protection
./scripts/verify-protection.sh
```
